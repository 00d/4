<h2>At the Crossroads of Everywhere</h2>

  Cantanor - Common name derived from the Elven word cantanórë, meaning "four lands."

  Cantanor is one of innumerable worlds speckling the vast expanse of the Material
  Plane. It is wild and savage, abundant in life, and steeped in the preternatural
  essence of the fey. Scattered across the four continents, civilization is strong
  but sparse, bordered by the ever encroaching Wilderness and oceans of roiling
  chaos. Cradling all of this, it is said, are the sublime branches of the cosmic
  World Tree.

  Like sylvan roads, the limbs of the World Tree breach the incomprehensible
  distances between worlds of the Material Plane: realms of giants, dragons, fire,
  shadow, and stranger things. Many myths surround the World Tree, but few mortals
  can dare to challenge its secrets...
