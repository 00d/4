# Of Cantanor

These things also I have observed: that knowledge of our world is to be nurtured like a precious flower, for it is the most precious thing we have. Wherefore guard the word written and heed words unwritten and set them down ere they fadeâ€¦ Learn then, well, the arts of reading, writing, and listening true, and they will lead you to the greatest art of all: understanding.
